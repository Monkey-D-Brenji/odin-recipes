    <h2>A Korean comfort stew dish</h2>
    <p>This is a Korean stew made with soybean paste and veggies.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 ounces any cuts of beef (or ground beef), cut very thinly</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>4 ounces potato, peeled and cut into ½-inch dice</li>
      <li>4 ounces onion, cut into ½-inch dice</li>
      <li>4 ounces zucchini, cut into ½-inch dice</li>
      <li>¼ cup doenjang (Korean fermented soybean paste)</li>
      <li>4 ounces medium-firm tofu, cut into ½-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 green chili pepper or jalapeño, sliced</li>
      <li>1 green onion, sliced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon gochu-garu (Korean hot pepper flakes; optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place a heavy, medium sized pot over medium heat. When it is hot, add
        the vegetable oil, beef, and garlic. Cook, stirring, for a few minutes,
        until the beef is no longer pink. Add 2 cups water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and cook for 10 minutes over medium heat. If it begins to boil
        over, crack the lid.
      </li>
      <li>Add the potato, onion, zucchini, and doenjang.</li>
      <li>
        Cover and cook for another 10 minutes. Stir the stew to make sure that
        the soybean paste is evenly incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the tofu, green chili pepper, green onion, and gochu-garu (if used).
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and cook for about 5 minutes, until the tofu softens and the stew
        is bubbling. Serve right away with rice, kimchi, and more side dishes.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can refrigerate the stew for up to 3 days. When you want to have
        some, reheat gently on top of the stove.
      </li>
